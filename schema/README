Schema files are processed by rcsm provider type, and if adding new schema files to the RMDMIA place 
them in the correct provider folder. If that folder does not exist create that folder to match the 
associated rcsm provider name.
Schema files should be structured in a package based folder structure. The package and file name will 
be passed to the associated RCSM Instruction Object generator for handling, then the file will be moved 
to a processed folder to avoid being reprocessed at a following startup.
