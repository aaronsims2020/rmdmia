/** Abstract class for Decision Manager provider implementors. The DecisionManagerProvider class 
 * initializes the Decision Manager Provider into the RMDMIA system via an automatic 
 * provider identifier, and registration of Provider Properties into the file system. 
 * A Decision Manager Provider jar can provide a default Properties file into the RMDMIA 
 * Decision Manager Provider Jar distribution, that will automatically copy and load the 
 * Properties file to the RMDMIA implementation file system for non-default 
 * properties modification. RMDMIA systems that do not provide access to the 
 * file system will use the default Decision Manager Provider Properties as defined in the 
 * Decision Manager JAR distribution.
 * 
 * The Decision Manager manages Robot/Object interaction, and path to follow upon
 * decision.
 * 
 * Object Interaction scoring criteria includes:
 * Risk - Identified Object interaction risk.
 * Priority - Priority score to current task, or mission.
 * Rules - System, Mission, or Task Rules to evaluate against.
