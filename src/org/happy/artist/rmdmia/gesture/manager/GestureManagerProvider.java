/** Abstract class for Gesture Manager provider implementors. The GestureManagerProvider class 
 * initializes the Gesture Manager Provider into the RMDMIA system via an automatic 
 * provider identifier, and registration of Provider Properties into the file system. 
 * A Gesture Manager Provider jar can provide a default Properties file into the RMDMIA 
 * Gesture Manager Provider Jar distribution, that will automatically copy and load the 
 * Properties file to the RMDMIA implementation file system for non-default 
 * properties modification. RMDMIA systems that do not provide access to the 
 * file system will use the default Gesture Manager Provider Properties as defined in the 
 * Gesture Manager JAR distribution.
 * 
 * The Gesture Manager manages execution of Gestures, Dynamic Control Gestures.
 * Dynamic Control Gestures add the Movement Processor via the MovementProcessorManager
 * functionality. Movement Processor implements algorithmic movement control for 
 * movement calibration and movement based event launching. Algorithms built into 
 * movement processors are intended to increase/decrease numeric input parameters 
 * for movement updates in the RMDMIA. 
 * 
 * The Perception Engine accesses the Gesture Manager for Gesture Object Analysis.
