/** Abstract class for Instruction Manager provider implementors. The InstructionManagerProvider class 
 * initializes the Instruction Manager Provider into the RMDMIA system via an automatic 
 * provider identifier, and registration of Provider Properties into the file system. 
 * A Instruction Manager Provider jar can provide a default Properties file into the RMDMIA 
 * Instruction Manager Provider Jar distribution, that will automatically copy and load the 
 * Properties file to the RMDMIA implementation file system for non-default 
 * properties modification. RMDMIA systems that do not provide access to the 
 * file system will use the default Instruction Manager Provider Properties as defined in the 
 * Instruction Manager JAR distribution.
