/** Abstract class for Mission Manager provider implementors. The MissionManagerProvider class 
 * initializes the Mission Manager Provider into the RMDMIA system via an automatic 
 * provider identifier, and registration of Provider Properties into the file system. 
 * A Mission Manager Provider jar can provide a default Properties file into the RMDMIA 
 * Mission Manager Provider Jar distribution, that will automatically copy and load the 
 * Properties file to the RMDMIA implementation file system for non-default 
 * properties modification. RMDMIA systems that do not provide access to the 
 * file system will use the default Mission Manager Provider Properties as defined in the 
 * Mission Manager JAR distribution.
 * 
 * The Mission Manager manages execution of top level mission, multiple sub-missions, 
 * and tasks in the RMDMIA. 
 * The Perception Engine accesses the Mission Manager for Mission Object Analysis.
