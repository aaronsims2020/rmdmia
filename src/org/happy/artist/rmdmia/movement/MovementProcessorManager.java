/** MovementProcessorManager.java - Movement Processor Manager Object Prototype.
 * Movement Processor ents algorithmic movement control for movement 
 * calibration and movement based event launching. Algorithms built into movement 
 * processors are intended to increase/decrease numeric input parameters for 
 * movement updates. Modifying the movements in a movement processor manner 
 * is not efficient and in a later release the architecture of the RMDMIA will 
 * need to be re-architected. 
 * 
 * The Movement Processing Manager Object will support the following functions 
 * to support managing movement processors (planned to be used by Gestures):
 *  - add
 *  - remove
 *  - hold
 *  - continue 
 *  - start 
 *  - stop
 *  - recycle
 * 
 * A movement processor interface must be defined for movement processor 
 * implementers to define processing rules for a test method to determine if the 
 * current registered processor will modify data, call a gesture, or perform 
 * an action. Movement Processors are intended to be used for calibrating movements.

     *  Note: All add and remove operations are synchronized to avoid conflict of using the same counter variables while processing (this is correctable with more variables, however, it is not anticipated during the prototype implementation that adding and removing of registered movement processors will be performed while the robot is processing movements, if necessary this can be modified later to ensure new processors can be added/removed while processing occurs, but for the time being this is the implementation in the prototype Obviously we do not want movement processing instructions being performed and having the entire robots movement pause temporarily while the robot is in movement (That said the pause would be at the microsecond level and likely would not be noticable unless the robot were under a high CPU utilization at the time of the add/remove movement processor to notice. Additional potential conflicts could come from using the following methods that would need to be synchronized if add/remove methods are not synchronized: getNextMovementIDByHardwareID, and validateUnusedMovementProcesserID. This information is provided to assist the person that undoubtedly will be updating the methods to run without interference in movement processor process method execution/interference (This undoubtedly will be an issue on somebodies robot platform in the unforseen future.) An additional note is fewer variables means better power efficiency in most cases, therefore, it is important to remember most implementations had efficiency and power consumption in mind when implementing the API the way it implemented for the DRC competition. Another note: the processing arrays need to be reconstructed in the current implementation which is the primary reason this method is synchronized (just remembered when implementing remove.), however, it was an intentional trade because the array data accesses are 3 to 8 times faster then collection object gets when repeatedly accessed (as in this implementation).
