 * will implement the process methods using Abstract MessageHandler classes, however,
 * some MessageHandlerInterface implementations use the process method for other purposes.
 * Non-persistent service message handler interface implementations including 
 * DefaultServiceMessageHandler, and AbstractServiceMessageHandler are an example of 
 * classes that use the process methods for other purposes, that must us the
