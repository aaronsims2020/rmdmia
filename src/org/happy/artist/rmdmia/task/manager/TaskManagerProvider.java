/** Abstract class for Task Manager provider implementors. The TaskManagerProvider class 
 * initializes the Task Manager Provider into the RMDMIA system via an automatic 
 * provider identifier, and registration of Provider Properties into the file system. 
 * A Task Manager Provider jar can provide a default Properties file into the RMDMIA 
 * Task Manager Provider Jar distribution, that will automatically copy and load the 
 * Properties file to the RMDMIA implementation file system for non-default 
 * properties modification. RMDMIA systems that do not provide access to the 
 * file system will use the default Task Manager Provider Properties as defined in the 
 * Task Manager JAR distribution.
 * 
 * The Task Manager manages execution of individual tasks, and Gestures in the RMDMIA. 
 * The Perception Engine accesses the Task Manager for Task Object Analysis.
